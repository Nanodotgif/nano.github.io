        <h1 class="title">Hello, I'm Joshua Brown</h1>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am passionate about all things technology and a firm believer in the good computers can do for humanity.
            From game development in C# to data manipulation in Python, I'm devoted to learning about new ways to use technology.
            This website serves as a catalogue of the projects I have been working on, big and small, and as a record of the new things I learn and places I go.</p>

            <p>This is my image's caption and I need to make it much longer to test the overflow.</p>

        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>This website was created not only as a way to catalogue my journey though computer science, but also as a fun way to practice web development. I have experimented with web development before in the past, such as making small games and a calculator website, but this website is my first attempt at a truly <i>good</i> website.</p>
        <h2>ASCII Renderer</h2>
        <p>One concept I find extremely captivating is that of creative restraint, meaning that restraints placed upon someone that relate to a creative project lead said someone to express more creativity in their completion of the project. This, fundamentally, is what led to ASCII Renderer: my attempt at creating a rendering engine in the command line using Python.
            "Engine" is used in a light sense here, the system is only capable of displaying simple images made of text characters, indicative of "ASCII art".</p>
        <h2>Time Calculator</h2>
        <p>The time calculator stemmed from my desire to create something that is useful and polished, more of a product than a project. It isn't perfect, but it helped me practice the complete execution of creating a purpose-built product, from design to deployment.
            You can find the finished project <a href="https://nanodotgif.github.io/time-calculator">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Gridline Skies</h2>
        <p>Gridline Skies was my first attempt at creating a basic video game with the Unity Engine. Though it hasn't been fully completed, the game did make it to a playable beta state. Making games with Unity has been a great motivator for me to learn more about C# and programming in general.</p>
