I apologize for your being here!!!

This is just a random collection of HTML/JS/CSS projects that I make when I'm bored! Most of them are useless, but I hope they can be a little fun to mess around with :)

### Can't figure out how to get to any of the pages??
That's because I haven't made it obvious yet, simply type "nav" into the awesome cli and then the name of the page(excluding ".html")
